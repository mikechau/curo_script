= kurotrade

This is to test eventual logic that will be integrated into kurotrade.

Goals:

- Display End of Day Market Prices after a Buy Transaction is Executed
- Stop Displaying End of Day Market(EOD) Price after a Sell and Qty is Zero
- Do not display repeating EOD Market Prices if there is Overlap with Buys
- Order display by Date
- Track Open Position Qty
- Calculate Net Asset Value (NAV)

= FAQ:
1. Why is this called Curo instead of Kuro?
- Done on purpose! :)
